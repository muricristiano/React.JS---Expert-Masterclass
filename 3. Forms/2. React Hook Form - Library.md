# React Hook Form - Library

Controled + Uncontrolled 
// Gets the benefits of two.

Real time info + No reload

### register
### handleSubmit
### watch

> npm i react-hook-form

```tsx
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'

export function EXAMPLECOMPONENT(){
      const {register, handleSubmit, watch} = useForm()
}


```

# register
> Register adds additional functionality and configurations to the input and receives information from the input for use within the register by React Hook Form. This information is used by React Hook Form to track and manage the input's state, validate user input, and display error messages if necessary.


USABILITY IN INPUTS:
```tsx
    <TaskInput
        type="text"
        placeholder="What are you going to work on?"

        // Here we define the name of the Input (Remove the standard "name={}" property ), React Hook Form will register this input, for handling conditions, values, etc.
        {...register('task-description')} 
    />

    // To register a number input as a number, we use a parameter of register() to specify as a number like example below:
    {...register('minutesAmount', { valueAsNumber: true })}
```


# handleSubmit
> To use the registered inputs informations.
> On the form, we use the `handleSubmit` of React Hook Form, a function that execute our function that will handle the registered informations.
> It's a way of register also the function and get the infos togheter.

USABILITY ON THE FORM (PARENT OF INPUTS):
```ts
// Our function
function handleCreateNewCycle(data: any){
    console.log(data);
}

//Usability of handleSubmit hook and where (in the parent form)
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(handleCreateNewCycle)}/>
```


# watch
> Function that Watch variables/elements in Real Time.
> Can be attributed to a CONST to further control/info/calculations/conditions.

USABILITY EXAMPLE, IN A BUTTON DISABLED CONTITIONER:

```tsx
    // Declarative const, explaining the condition is being watched: watch('') must receive the name of registered input on react hook form.
    const inputTaskDescriptionHasContent = watch('task-description')

    // Using the const in the boolean property 'disabled' to show availability of the button.
    <button
        disabled={!inputTaskDescriptionHasContent}
        type="submit"
    >
        Start
    </button>
```
