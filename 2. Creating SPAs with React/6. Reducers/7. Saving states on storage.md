# Let's save our data in storage
Free of API and Databases

- localStorage.setItem
- localStorage.getItem
- date as string handling
- amount seconds passed
- initialState

1. > Only accepts text, string, but in format.

2. > Can be read as JSON.



# setItem
> 1/3

activitiesContext.tsx:
```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const stateJSON = JSON.stringify(activitiesState)
    localStorage.setItem('@productivity-timer:activities-state-v1.0', stateJSON)
  }, [activitiesState])
```


-> Will be loaded in first opening the app.
-> Will storage new activities every time a new activity is started, because of the depencencies of the useEffect. 

> TIP: 
Put the name of the application before the state name, just to make sure that no storage will replace another.

# getItem
> 2/3

useReducer can receive a third parameter 

activitiesContext.tsx:
```tsx
  const [activitiesState, dispatch] = useReducer(
    activitiesReducerActions,
    {
      activities: [],
      activeActivityID: null,
    },

    // The third parameter, a function
    (initialState) => {
      const storedStateAsJSON = localStorage.getItem(
        '@productivity-timer:activities-state-v1.0',
      )

    // If founds, return found data
      if (storedStateAsJSON) {
        return JSON.parse(storedStateAsJSON)
      }
    
    // if not, just return the initial empty state
      return initialState
    },
  )
```
-> Will get from the localStorage if available.

-> Will return empty if not available.


# Handling DATES as string on localStorage
> 3/3

Countdowm/index.tsx:
```tsx
const differenceTime = differenceInSeconds(
    new Date(),
    new Date(activeActivity.startDate), // LocalStorage Date String handling (Converts to data if it is a string)
)
```

BEFORE IT WAS JUST:
>     activeActivity.startDate
used to compare, not converting the string from localStorage to data.



# secondsTimerPassed state, calculating the initial value by getting the localStorage info.
> 3/3
    Doing this, we'll get the totalSecondsPassed just in the app loading. If it is a existent activity running. If not, will return the default 0.


> ActivitiesContext.tsx:

BEFORE:
```tsx
const [secondsTimerPassed, setSecondsTimerPassed] = useState(0)
```

AFTER:
```tsx
  const [secondsTimerPassed, setSecondsTimerPassed] = useState(() => {
    if (activeActivity) {
      return differenceInSeconds(new Date(), new Date(activeActivity.startDate))
    }
    return 0
  })
```
