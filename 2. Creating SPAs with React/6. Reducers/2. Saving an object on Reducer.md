# useReducer

Can create multiple data in just 1 useReducer.

Example:
1 useReducer = 3 useStates (related states)

> Pattern used for a lot of situations.

Example of usage:

```tsx
const [activitiesState, dispatch] = useReducer(
(state: activitiesReducer, action: any) => {

    // Receives the data, and the actions to proceed
    if (action.type === 'ADD_NEW_ACTIVITY') { 
    return {
        ...state,
        activities: [...state.activities, action.payload.newActivity],
        activeActivityID: action.payload.newActivity.id,
    }}
    
    // Receives the data, and the actions to proceed
    if (action.type === 'INTERRUPT_CURRENT_ACTIVITY') { 
    return {
        ...state,
        activities: state.activities.map((item) => {
        if (item.id === state.activeActivityID) {
            return { ...item, interruptedDate: new Date() }
        } else {
            return item
        }}),
        activeActivityID: null,
    }}
    return state
}, {
    activities: [],
    activeActivityID: null,
})
```
