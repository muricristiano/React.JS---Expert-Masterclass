# immer - library

Handle IMMUTABLE data (states / reducers) as MUTABLE objects.

Allowing usage of common array functions in data like Array States.

few examples:

xState.push();
xState.pop();
xState.findIndex();
xState = newData;
    
    etc...


1. Instalattion
> npm i immer


2. Import
```ts
import { produce } from 'immer'
```

3. Usage:
```tsx
produce( state, draft => {

})
```

> draft => is mutable copy of the state

OBS: The draft represents the state, it's a copy, but in a MUTABLE version. So we can handle it as a MUTABLE object/array/reducer/etc.

The immer will handle it in background, and update the state/reducer, in a immutable way by interpretating the changes.

# Real usage on the project:

# 1. Adding and starting new activity.

>BEFORE:
reducer.ts:
```TSX
return {
    ...state,
    activities: [...state.activities, action.payload.newActivity],
    activeActivityID: action.payload.newActivity.id,
}
```

> AFTER immer:
reducer.ts:
```tsx
return produce( state , draft => {
    draft.activities.push(action.payload.newActivity)
    draft.activeActivityID = action.payload.newActivity.id
})
```


# 2. Completing the current activity.

> BEFORE:
reducer.ts:
```tsx
return {
    ...state,
    activities: state.activities.map((item) => {
        if (item.id === state.activeActivityID) {
            return { ...item, finishedDate: new Date() }
        } else {
            return item
        }
}),
    activeActivityID: null,
}
```

> AFTER immer:
reducer.ts:
```tsx
      return produce(state, (draft) => {
        const currentActivityIndex = draft.activities.findIndex((item) => {
          return item.id === draft.activeActivityID
        })

        if (currentActivityIndex < 0) {
          return state
        }

        draft.activities[currentActivityIndex].interruptedDate = new Date()
        draft.activeActivityID = null
      })
```
