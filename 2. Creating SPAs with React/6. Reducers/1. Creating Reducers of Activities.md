# Reducer (useReducer)

> It is a React Tool to substitute a 'useState (state)' in some cases to improve the development:
Can reduce a lot of code by using all the logics of an function created that can be used in another directories of the project.

Usage:
```tsx
import { useReducer } from 'react'

// Instead of:   const [activities, setActivities] = useState<Activity[]>([])
  const [activities, dispatch] 
    = useReducer((state: Activity[], action: any) => {return state}, [])

```
