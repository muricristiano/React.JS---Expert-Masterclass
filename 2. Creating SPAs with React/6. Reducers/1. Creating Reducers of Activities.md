# Reducer (useReducer)

> It is a React Tool to replace a 'useState (state)' in some cases to improve the development:

Unifying and Simplefying all the multiple and possible handling ways that would have a unique state. All in one place.


> 1/2. Easy kindly illustration, not real example:
list = useReducer {
  if (action.type === 'ADD') {
    ... adding code
  }  
  
  if (action.type === 'DELETE') {
    ... adding code
  }  
  
  if (action.type === 'INTERRUPT') {
    ... adding code
  }
}

> 2/2. Then using, just illustration:
  dispatch({
    type: 'ADD',
    payload: {
      data
    }
  })



# The real mechanics of the useReducer:

1. > Knowing a bit:
```tsx
import { useReducer } from 'react'



// Instead of:   const [activities, setActivities] = useState<Activity[]>([])

// useReducer structure:
  const [activities, dispatch] = useReducer((state, action) => {
    return state
  }, [])

// const [reducedStateExample, dispatchCanBeAnyFlexibleFunction] = useReducer((stateCurrent, possibleAction) => {function to be executed}, [initial value])

```

2. > Typing the state and actionin real example:
```tsx
  const [activities, dispatch] = useReducer((state: Activity[], action: any) => {
    return state
  }, [])
```

the state, is being typed as an array of Activity[].
