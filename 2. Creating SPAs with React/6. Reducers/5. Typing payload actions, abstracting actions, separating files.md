 #  Improving Actions Properties by Typing
 # + Clean coding
 # + Productivity
 # + Organized Project  
     
1. > New folder structure:
reducers/activities/
        - reducer.ts (Will have the reducers and lower functions)
        - actions.ts (Will have the types of actions, and a second layer with the "dispatch" content functions).

contexts/ActivitiesContext.tsx: Will have the third and last layer, calling the functions all the way.


1/3: First layer
> reducer.ts:
```ts
import { ActionTypes } from './actions'

  switch (action.type) {
    case ActionTypes.ADD_NEW_ACTIVITY:
      return {
        ...state,
        activities: [...state.activities, action.payload.newActivity],
        activeActivityID: action.payload.newActivity.id,
      }
  }
```

2/3: Second layer
> actions.ts:
```ts
mport { Activity } from './reducer'

export enum ActionTypes {
  ADD_NEW_ACTIVITY = 'ADD_NEW_ACTIVITY',
  MARK_CURRENT_ACTIVITY_AS_FINISHED = 'MARK_CURRENT_ACTIVITY_AS_FINISHED',
  INTERRUPT_CURRENT_ACTIVITY = 'INTERRUPT_CURRENT_ACTIVITY',
}

export function addNewActivityAction(newActivity: Activity) {
  return {
    type: ActionTypes.ADD_NEW_ACTIVITY,
    payload: {
      newActivity,
    },
  }
}
```

3/3: Third and last layer
> ActivitiesContext:
```tsx
  function createNewActivity(data: CreateActivityData) {
    const newActivity: Activity = {
      id: String(new Date().getTime()),
      task: data.taskDescription,
      duration: data.timeAmount,
      startDate: new Date(),
    }

    dispatch(addNewActivityAction(newActivity))

    setActiveActivityName(newActivity.task)
    setSecondsTimerPassed(0)
  }
```
