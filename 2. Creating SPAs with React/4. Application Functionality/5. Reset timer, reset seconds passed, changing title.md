# useEffect returns function!
> Reseting Timer
At this point we were setting a timer to run. But a new activity is not being handled.

```tsx
useEffect(() => { 
    // Code of useEffect
    return () => {} // <-- useEffects can return a clean up function for the last time useEffect was executed.
}. [])
```

This way, we can reset the setInterval of the previous execution, by using the function clearInterval(), which have to take a variable inside it. 

> clearInterval(VariableToBeReseted)

So we need to attribute the setInterval to a variable first

```tsx
useEffect(() => {

// Creating a variable on higher scope of the useEffect    
let interval: number;

// Now, its in the variable
interval = setInterval(() => {})...

// Now we can use the function to clear:
return () => {
    clearInterval(interval)
}

}, [dependencyExample])
```


# Reseting Seconds Passed

The moment we create a new Activity, we are setting the "SecondsTimePassed" difference, in each second, but when we create another one. We need to reset it to zero. So the setInterval starts to increase from zero, to make a new calculation.

> On creation of a new task:

We need to reset it to zero:
```tsx
    setSecondsTimerPassed(0)
```

# BONUS: Changing the Title with a Countdown and the name of the task

We can change the title, in real time. If we have a state as a property for the title or dependence state on useEffect.

```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    if (activeActivity) {
      document.title = `${minutes}:${seconds} 
    - ${activeTaskName?.task}`
    }
  }, [minutes, seconds, activeActivity, activeTaskName])
```
