# useEffect returns function!
> Reseting Timer
At this point we were setting a timer to run. But a new activity (second) is not being handled.

```tsx
useEffect(() => { 
    // Functionality of useEffect
    return () => {} // <-- useEffects can return a clean up function for the last time useEffect was executed.
}. [])
```

This way, we can reset the setInterval of the previous execution, by using the function clearInterval(), which have to take a variable inside it. 

> clearInterval(VariableToBeReseted)

So we need to attribute the setInterval to a variable first

```tsx
useEffect(() => {

// Creating a variable on higher scope, still inside of the useEffect    
let interval: number;

// Now, we use the variable to receive the setInterval to this variable, 
interval = setInterval(() => {})...

// Now we can use the ending function to clear:
return () => {
    clearInterval(interval)
}

}, [dependencyExample])
```

FINAL USEEFFECT FUNCTION RETURN:
> Executes from the second time is executed, so we can handle something in it (cleaning for example)

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  let interval: number

  if (activeActivity) {
    interval = setInterval(() => {
      setAmountSecondsPassed(
        differenceInSeconds(new Date(), activeActivity.startDate)
      )
    }, 1000)
  }

  return () => { // THIS IS THE RETURN THAT WILL EXECUTE WHEN THE USEEFFECT IS ACTIVATED AGAIN AFTER THE FIRST TIME.
    clearInterval(interval)
  }
}, [activeActivity])
```


# Reseting Seconds Passed

The moment we create a new Activity, we are setting the "SecondsTimePassed" difference, in each second, but when we create another one. We need to reset it to zero. So the setInterval starts to increase from zero, to make a new calculation.

> On creation of a new task:

We need to reset it to zero:
```tsx
    setSecondsTimerPassed(0)
```

# BONUS: Changing the Title with a Countdown and the name of the task

We can change the title, in real time. If we have a state as a property for the title or dependence state on useEffect.

```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    if (activeActivity) {
      document.title = `${minutes}:${seconds} 
    - ${activeTaskName?.task}`
    }
  }, [minutes, seconds, activeActivity, activeTaskName])
```
