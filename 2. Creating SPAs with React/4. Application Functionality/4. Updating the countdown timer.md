# WHY NOT: setInterval | setTimeout
Their time generally are not exact. 
> Depends on the processor performance (Depends on the device performance), can be slowed down by miliseconds in each interval.

# EXAMPLE OF CODE BELOW THAT WON'T WORK AS EXPECTED:
```tsx
  useEffect(() => {
      if (activeActivity){
        setInterval(() => {
            setAmountSecondsPassed(state => state + 1) // Incrementing 1 second passed on each 1000 miliseconds, BUT:
        }, 1000) // This 1000 miliseconds aren't exact, so every second incremented won't match the real miliseconds passeds.
  }, [])
```

# SOLUTION:

# Preparation for the strategy used:
```tsx

// 1 - Interace new property
interface Activity {
  id: string
  task: string
  duration: number
  startDate: Date // -> A new property for the Activity object.
}


// 2 - function Create New Activity new handling property
  function handleCreateNewActivity(data: NewActivityFormProps) {
    const newActivity: Activity = {
      id: String(new Date().getTime()),
      task: data.taskDescription,
      duration: data.timeAmount,
      startDate: new Date(), // -> A new auto generated property for the Activity object, with the date, which we'll handle for the countdown timer real time update.
    }

```

3. > npm i date-fns
For handling dates tools.

And importing the tool:
> import {differenceInSeconds} from 'date-fns'


# GREAT NOTE FOR THE STRATERY:

```TSX
  useEffect(() => {
    if (activeActivity) {
      setInterval(() => {
        // Here, we will CONSULT the information information in different miliseconds, but the information CONSULTED would be CONSISTENT! by comparison of dates at the start of useEffect and at the creation of the Cycle Started, with its property info!!
        setSecondsTimerPassed(
          differenceInSeconds(new Date(), activeActivity.startDate),
        )
      }, 1000)
    }
  }, [activeActivity])
```


### OBSERVATIONS: Of course, we are not handling double activities started, we are not handling an interruption, etc. So yet we have a lot to develop and handle.
