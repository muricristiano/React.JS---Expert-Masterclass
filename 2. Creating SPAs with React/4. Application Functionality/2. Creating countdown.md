### Creating the active Countdown

1 - Create a variable to check if there is any active activity, and then convert the number of minutes in seconds, so we can watch the value in every change.

```tsx
  const totalActivitySeconds = activeActivity ? activeActivity.duration * 60 : 0
```


2 - Create a state of secondTimerPassed, to keep subtracting from the total seconds value, every second and show in the screen on every load.

```tsx
  const [secondsTimerPassed, setSecondsTimerPassed] = useState(0)
```

3 - Create a const of TIMER REMAINING to show in the screen, that will be the total amount of time in seconds, minus the number already passed on every second.

```tsx
  const currentSecondsRemaining = activeActivity
    ? totalActivitySeconds - secondsTimerPassed
    : 0
```

4 - Now that we have the timer remaining in seconds, we have to convert to be show as MM:SS, in the screen.

We have to create they separately:

```tsx
  // Here we get the seconds total amount and divide per 60, getting the floor (Entire Integers)
  const minutesAmount = Math.floor(currentSecondsRemaining / 60)

  // Here we get the seconds remaining, by calculating the rest of the total seconds divided by 60, and getting the rest = 0 to 59
  const secondsAmount = currentSecondsRemaining % 60
```

## Length and Characters Patterns For Strings = padStart | padEnd

5- Patterns to show the zeros if there are less than 10 minutes, or less than 10 seconds.

> We create another const, that will convert to String, and make use a function .padStart, to determine how many characters our string will have (in this case 2), and what will be the caracter that will replace this empties "houses" to fill the objective length (in this case, the zero: 0)
```tsx
  const minutes = String(minutesAmount).padStart(2, '0')
  const seconds = String(secondsAmount).padStart(2, '0')
```


# Strings can be used as Arrays.

6 - Finally, we are going to use these consts to show in the screen as they were Arrays:

> minutes word position 0
> minutes word position 1
> seconds word position 0
> seconds word position 1
```tsx
        <CountdownContainer>
          <span>{minutes[0]}</span>
          <span>{minutes[1]}</span>
          <Separator>:</Separator>
          <span>{seconds[0]}</span>
          <span>{seconds[1]}</span>
        </CountdownContainer>
```
