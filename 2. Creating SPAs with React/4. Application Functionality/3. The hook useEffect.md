# useEffect

A hook that execute when the page is loaded, and can reload if we determine a condition to watch on change (state, when it changes) Watching and monitoring the state.

> import { useEffect } from 'react'

The usability:
```tsx
// The structure:
useEffect(() => {}, [])


// The parameters:
useEffect(() => {Function to execute}, [WatchedState])

// Example:
useEffect(() => {getAndShowAllItems()}, [listOfItems])
```


If we want to something execute only when is loaded, we let the condition empty:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {executeOnlyOneTime}, [])
```

## OBSERVATION:
We don't need to create a useEffect to watch another useEffect, we can create only a const, that will load a information that reads a state, It's easier.
