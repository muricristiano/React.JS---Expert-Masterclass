# Converting all into Context
1. > Create a interface for all the Properties shared inside the Context:
Home.tsx:
```tsx
interface ActivitiesContextType {
  activeActivity: Activity | undefined
  activeActivityID: string | null
  activeActivityName: string | null
  markCurrentActivityAsFinished: () => void
  resetCurrentActivity: () => void
}
```

2. > Create the context and type as the interface we Created:
Home.tsx:
```tsx
export const ActivitiesContext = createContext({} as ActivitiesContextType)
```

3. > Provide, with the inteface required (or not required) especifications:
Home.tsx:
```tsx
<ActivitiesContext.Provider
          value={{
            activeActivity,
            activeActivityID,
            activeActivityName,
            markCurrentActivityAsFinished,
            resetCurrentActivity,
          }}
        >
          <NewActivityForm />
          <Countdown />
        </ActivitiesContext.Provider>
```

4. > use the useContext to receive data to foward handling, by destructuring the parameters and typing the context:
```tsx
const {
    activeActivity,
    activeActivityID,
    activeActivityName,
    markCurrentActivityAsFinished,
    resetCurrentActivity,
  } = useContext(ActivitiesContext)
```

5. > FINISHED!
Just handle the data provided as used to be.
All the data inside the Provider scope will be conected and reloaded inside the Provider.
