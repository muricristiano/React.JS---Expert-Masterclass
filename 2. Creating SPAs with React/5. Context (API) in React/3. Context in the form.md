# Context in the form
1. > receive already created context by useContext:
   
NewActivityForm.tsx:
```tsx
  const { activeActivity } = useContext(ActivitiesContext)
```

2. > Move all the destructured tools of RHF to the Home.tsx:

# Context in the React Hook Form ( ...register )
> RHF has its own Context

1. > Instead of make the usual destructure:

NewActivityForm.tsx:
```tsx
const { register, handleSubmit, watch, reset } = useForm<>({})
```

2. > Do like this on the declaration, and only destructurate the tools of useForm, below it, separately:
```tsx
const newActivityForm = useForm<>({}) // Not destructuring the useForm

// Remove register because we dont use it on Home.tsx 
const { handleSubmit, watch, reset } = newActivityForm; // Now we still have the complete access to the const "newActivityForm" that is a useForm
```


3. > The React Hook Form, Context Provider mechanics:
A provider component tool of RHF that propagates a specific useForm, with all of its methods and tools to all children components via React Context API.
```tsx
// Here we spread the useForm declared.
<FormProvider {...newActivityForm}>  
  <NewActivityForm />
<FormProvider />
```

4. > How to import this context in the children target component:
NewActivityForm.tsx:
```tsx
const {register} = useFormContext(newActivityForm) // Here we specify which useForm we are using, declaring a useFormContext! This must be provided by the previous step above we just created.
```
Now we can use all the tools of the react hook form that is linked to the form created.


6. > Now we can use register inside this component using the same useForm shared thought context.
