# Context in the form
1. > use the useContext:
```tsx
  const { activeActivity } = useContext(ActivitiesContext)
```

# Context in the React Hook Form ( ...register )
> RHF has its own Context

1. > Instead of make the usual destructe:

```tsx
const { register, handleSubmit, watch, reset } = useForm<>({})
```

2. > Do this:
```tsx
const newActivityForm = useForm
```

3. > And then destructure it, separetely:
```tsx
// Remove register because we dont use it on Home.tsx 
const { handleSubmit, watch, reset } = newActivityForm;
```


4. > The React Hook Form, Context Provider mechanics:
A provider component that propagates the useForm methods to all children components via React Context API.
<FormProvider {...newActivityForm}> // Here we spread the useForm declared.
  <NewActivityForm />
<FormProvider />

5. > How to import this context in the final children target component:
NewActivityForm.tsx:
```tsx
const {register} = useFormContext(newActivityForm) // Here we specify which useForm we are using, declaring a useFormContext! This must be provided by the previous step above.
```
Now we can use all the tools of the react hook form that is linked to the form created.


6. > Now we can use register inside this component using the same useForm shared thought context.
