# History list using the Activities state:

Simple, if is there a possible ?finishedDate (possible to be a null data), is completed.

Completed:
1. > ?finishedDate = Completed style: green color and 'Completed' text

Interrupted:
2. > ?interruptedDate = Interrupted style: red color and 'Interrupted' text

In progress:
3. >and if is there no ?finishedDate && no ?InterruptedDate = In Progress style: yellow color and 'In Progress' text


We use the context to import the state:
```tsx
  const { activities } = useContext(ActivitiesContext)
```


We map the state to render with the conditions:
```tsx
    <tbody>
    {activities.map((activity) => {
        return (
        <tr key={activity.id}>
            <td>{activity.task}</td>
            <td>{activity.duration}</td>
            <td>{activity.startDate.toISOString()}</td>
            <td>
            {activity.finishedDate && (
                <Status statusColor="green">Completed</Status>
            )}
            {activity.interruptedDate && (
                <Status statusColor="red">Interrupted</Status>
            )}
            {!activity.finishedDate && !activity.interruptedDate && (
                <Status statusColor="yellow">In progress</Status>
            )}
            </td>
        </tr>
        )
    })}
    </tbody>
```
