# How to use the reset() and any other tools from RHF in the functions of Context, if we don't want to use External Libraries in them.

1. > Remove these tools completely.

2. > Create a new function in the Children Page/Component to use this PARENT FUNCTION received by context. And inside this children function, we use the External Libraries:
Home.tsx:
```tsx
const newActivityForm = useForm()

const { reset , handleSubmit} = newActivityForm

function handleCreateNewActivity(data: NewActivityFormProps) {
    createNewActivity(data)
    reset() // Here it is!
}
```
Function:
```tsx
    onSubmit={handleSubmit(handleCreateNewActivity)}
```


# THE CONTEXT PROVIDER, NEVER KNOWS ABOUT ANY LIBRARY. REMAINS INDEPENDENT.
