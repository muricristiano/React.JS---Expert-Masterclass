# How to use the reset() and any other tools from RHF in the functions of Context, if we don't want to use External Libraries in them.

1. > Remove these tools completely from the context.

2. > Create a new handling function (example: 'handleCreateNewActivity' on Home page, to execute 'CreateNewActivity' received from context, and then use the reset() from the library just below). 

> In another words: we do all this in the Children Page/Component to use this PARENT FUNCTION received by context. And inside this children function, we use these External Libraries:

# Home.tsx:
```tsx
const newActivityForm = useForm()

const { reset , handleSubmit} = newActivityForm

function handleCreateNewActivity(data: NewActivityFormProps) {
    createNewActivity(data) // Executing a context received function from the parent provider.
    reset() // Here it is!
}
```
Function:
```tsx
    onSubmit={handleSubmit(handleCreateNewActivity)} // Now we execute the handling instead of the received context function directly. So we can use the reset from RHF.
```


# THE CONTEXT PROVIDER, NEVER KNOWS ABOUT ANY LIBRARY. REMAINS INDEPENDENT.
