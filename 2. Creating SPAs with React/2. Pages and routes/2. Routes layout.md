# We can draw the Default Layouts Routes to obtain the pages inside, by maintaining the static elements in common between pages. And switching only what is different between pages.
Changing only what is different between pages. Accelerating only the pagination of different elements.

++ Speed loading components/elements.
++ Coding speed by avoid recoding.

## <Outlet />
Outlet is a tool("space") that will represent the switches of the pages that will be displayed.

1. > Create a layout in recommended directory, importing { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom':

/layouts/DefaultLayout.tsx:
```ts
import { Header } from '../components/Header'
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'

export function DefaultLayout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Outlet /> // This can be <Home/> or <History/> depending on the route.
    </div>
  )
}
```

/src/Router.tsx
2. > Create a new <Route> </Route> but now with closing that, encapsulating all the routes that will use the same default layout. And defining what is the layout: <Route path="/" element={<DefaultLayout/>}>, importing of course the {DefaultLayout} (In this project case, we will use for all the 2, but may have some other projects that have multiple possible default layouts for multiple pages/routes)
```ts
import { DefaultLayout } from './layouts/DefaultLayout'

      <Route path="/" element={<DefaultLayout />}>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/history" element={<History />} />
      </Route>
```


### CHAIN React Routes with "/":

<Route path="/admin" element={<AdminLayout />}>
    <Route path="/products" element={<Products />}>
</Route>

>The final route to access this page/route is "/admin/products".
