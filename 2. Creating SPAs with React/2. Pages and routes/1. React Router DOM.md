# React Router (The most famous library for routes in React)
Library to handle routes/pages

# We are going to use the React Router 'DOM' (The package for WEB)
> npm i react-router-dom

1. create the directory for the pages:
> /src/pages
Inside we create the pages (Will be only 2 in this project, Home and History. But you got the concept)

1. Create a component to be the handler of the React Router library, on the '/src' folder:
'Router.ts', the mechanics of the Router.ts and the usage of its library will be like this:

/src/Router.ts
```ts
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

// Import the pages here:
import { Home } from './pages/Home'
import { History } from './pages/History'

//The intuitive mechanics of the Router:
export function Router() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/history" element={<History />} />
    </Routes>
  )
}
```
Routes = scoped tag that handles the routes.
Route = self closing tag for every page.

path = the url adress.
element = The component page that would be shown.

1. > on App.tsx
We have to import the { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom' and use as a scope, to envolve the <Router/> so the tag <BrowserRouter> can handle the Router. And the Router, handle the routes.

App.tsx:
```ts
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import { Router } from './Router'

export function App() {
    <BrowserRouter>
        <Router />
    </BrowserRouter>
}
```
