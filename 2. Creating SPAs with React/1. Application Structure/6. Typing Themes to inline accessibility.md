# Typing Themes

For a better productive usage of themes using typescript. We can type up these themes. So we can use in production time, this emmet references and autocomplete, while using the themes properties.


Creating for example a structure like this:
> /src/@types/styled.d.ts

> d.ts = only DEFINITION of types for TS.
Files for only creation and exportation of interfaces and types.

Example:

styled.d.ts:
```ts
    import 'styled-components';
    import { defaultTheme } from '../styles/themes/defaultTheme'

    type ThemeType = typeof defaultTheme;

    // POINT OF INTEREST
    declare module 'styled-components' { 
        export interface DefaultTheme extends ThemeType{}
}
```

High complexity, but rare situations of setting. (1 time per project)

# Now, after this, we can use the suggestions and auto-completes of the theme we created.
