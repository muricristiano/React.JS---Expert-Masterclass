# Setting up themes

With Styled Components, we can create themes to style our application in different ways based on the chosen theme.

We need to import in App.jsx the
> import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

And we must create a folder with its themes, for example at /src/styles/themes/THEMES.ts with this syntax:
```ts
export const defaultTheme = {
    primary: 'purple',
    secondary: 'blue',
    danger: 'red',
    success: 'green'
}
```

After that, we import this:

App.jsx
> import { defaultTheme } from './styles/themes/defaultTheme';

And in the App.jsx component, we the ThemeProvider as a tag and defining the property "theme" as the imported theme we created: 

<ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
    "...contents on the App.jsx"
</ThemeProvider>


This properties can be accessed through all the project styles components.

```tsx
export const defaultTheme = {
    primary: 'purple',
    secondary: 'blue',
    danger: 'red',
    success: 'green'
}
```

For example, in a component style, we use the ".theme" as following by the "props":

```tsx
export const ButtonContainer = styled.button<ButtonContainerProps>`

    background-color: ${props => props.theme.primary}
`
```
