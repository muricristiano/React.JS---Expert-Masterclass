# Better integration of FORM with TypeScript

## Normal VS Zod Infer (Automatic PropsType/Interface)

## Normal
1/3 - Creating an Interface for the props form data to be handled:
```ts
interface NewActivityFormProps {
  task: string
  minutesAmount: number
}
```

2/3 - Declare the data to be handled as the interface props we defined, and received thought inputs:
```ts
  function handleCreateNewActivity(data: NewActivityFormProps) {
    console.log(data)
  }
```

3/3 - Declare the interface props also in the useForm, so React Hook Forms can use in the tools: defaultValues, the TS will check if the properties are valid and suggest them.
```ts
const { register, handleSubmit, watch } = useForm<NewActivityFormProps>({
    defaultValues: {
      task: '',
      minutesAmount: 0,
    }
})
```

### Zod Infer
1/3 - just create a type with a name, and use zod.infer<> converting the JS data to TS (typeof), and set the SCHEMA zod validation already created. 
OBS: THE SCHEMA WILL BE THE DECLARATIVE NAMES OF PROPERTIES, for all the properties in the page code. Registers will use it, and all the functions, and all the types props can select it, unifying all magnifficently.
```tsx
type NewActivityFormProps = zod.infer<typeof newActivityFormValidationSchemaZod>
```

2/3 - RHF Tools + validation zod = using the zod schema as type.
```tsx
 const { register, handleSubmit, watch } = useForm<NewActivityFormProps>({
```

3/3 - Functions using the zod schema as type.
```tsx
function handleCreateNewActivity(data: NewActivityFormProps) {
```

All the props are defined here, early before, content of the last classes before this one:
```ts
const newActivityFormValidationSchemaZod = zod.object({
  taskDescription: zod.string().min(1, 'Inform your activity'),
  timeAmount: zod
    .number()
    .min(5, 'Inform a time between 5 and 90 minutes')
    .max(90, 'Inform a time between 5 and 90 minutes'),
})
```
