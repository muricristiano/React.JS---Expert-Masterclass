# React Hook Form - Library

Controled + Uncontrolled 
// Gets the benefits of both.

Real time info + Only necessary reloads

Some of the Tools that work together to this goal:
### register
### handleSubmit
### watch

> npm i react-hook-form

```tsx
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'

// Tools declarations
export function EXAMPLECOMPONENT(){
      const {register, handleSubmit, watch} = useForm()
}


```

# register
> Register adds additional functionality and configurations to the input and receives information from the input for use within the register by React Hook Form. This information is used by React Hook Form to track and manage the input's state, validate user input, and display error messages if necessary.


USABILITY IN INPUTS:
```tsx
    <TaskInput
        type="text"
        placeholder="What are you going to work on?"
        // ' name="" ' has to be removed, restricted to RHF, RHF will use it to register.

        // Here we define the name of the Input (Remove the standard "name={}" property ), React Hook Form will register this input, for handling conditions, values, etc.
        {...register('task-description')} 
    />

    // To register a number input as a number, we use a parameter of register() to specify as a number like example below:
    {...register('minutesAmount', { valueAsNumber: true })}
```


# handleSubmit
> To use the registered inputs informations.
> On the form, we use the `handleSubmit` of React Hook Form, a function that execute our function that have and will move foward the "registered" data on useForm() (REACT HOOK FORM).
> It's a way of register also the function and get the infos togheter.

USABILITY ON THE FORM (PARENT OF INPUTS):
```ts
// Our function
function handleCreateNewCycle(data: any){
    //...
}

//Usability of handleSubmit hook and where (in the parent form)
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(handleCreateNewCycle)}/>
```


# watch
> Function Watch WORKS and UPDATES and is READED in REAL TIME.
> Can be attributed to a CONST to further control/info/calculate/condition or to enhance declaration.

USABILITY EXAMPLE (Scenario: A button can be disabled based on certain conditions):

```tsx
    // Declarative const, explaining the condition is being watched: watch('') must receive the REGISTERED input on react hook form.
    const inputTaskDescriptionHasContent = watch('task-description')
    // This will be a real time boolean variable.


    // Using the const in the boolean property 'disabled' to show availability of the button.
    <button
        disabled={!inputTaskDescriptionHasContent} // The real time variable being used and updated.
        type="submit"
    >
        Start
    </button>
```
