# Libraries for validations (yup / joi / zod) - All are great and pretty similar, whatever you choose is nice.
We are going to choose <zod> because have a little more support for typescript in this case.
Work more with type checking.

> npm i zod

Integration by REACT HOOK FORMS with other validation libraries:
> npm i @hookform/resolvers
- Integrations for zod/yup/joi, all of them in this one.
The React Hook Forms, use the great validation libraries already existing, so this package is a integration for these libraries.


1/3: The imports:
```tsx
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod' // React Hook Forms - Integration with ZOD
import * as zod from 'zod' // We have to import * as zod, because we dont have an export default, we would need to import each tool from 'zod' instead. but importing * as XVARIABLE from 'zod', works perfectly fine
```

2/3: The const to use zod tool of schema validation for the form submit:
```tsx
const newActivityFormValidationSchemaZod = zod.object({
  task: zod.string().min(1, 'Inform your activity'),
  minutesAmount: zod
    .number()
    .min(5, 'Inform a time between 5 and 90 minutes')
    .max(90, 'Inform a time between 5 and 90 minutes'),
})
```

3/3. React Hook Forms integration to use zod schema:
Declaration in React Hook Forms tools:
```tsx
  const { register, handleSubmit, watch } = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(newActivityFormValidationSchemaZod),
  })
```
