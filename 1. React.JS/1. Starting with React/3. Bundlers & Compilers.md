# Compilers (Oldest Methods)
Example: Babel
> Get the latest version of javascript and convert it into a compatible version for all the browsers.

# Bundlers (Oldest Methods)
Example: webpack
> Zip all the file of the projects and convert it into a unique file of .JS, .CSS and assets files.
Few years ago, when the browsers only supported one file of each type for the project. JS, HTML, CSS, etc.


# TODAYS Libraries (Do all this) (Newer Methods)
Example: Vite / Snowpack:
Most of the browsers now accept imports between different files inside the project, dont requiring a bundling anymore.

New Libraries use this native support for ECS and also compile the files:
Example: Vite (The most popular) / Snowpack
