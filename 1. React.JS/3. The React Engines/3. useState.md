# Listening Events (onSubmit={}) on the 'form' tag
> onSubmit={} 
can be sent in multiple ways (rather than a onClick button tag): (Pressing enter while typing / click on button / etc.)

# function for handling data (just the name of the function)
call the function onSubmit={}

# event.preventDefault() - on function that handle forms (onSubmit or onClick, etc.)
> event.preventDefault(), this will prevent default action of submit form to go to another page, which in SPA pattern wont be used. We may stay in the same page (at max, we use pagination).

# useState
Variables that a component can monitor at any change and update in real time.

> The Strucure
const [variable, setVariable] = useState();

1. First position is the Variable
2. Second position is a special function of react, that change the value of the first variable, and SEND an INTERFACE REFRESH REQUEST to React, so this way it will update in real time.

HINT:
always define the type, just to identify in the code, for better understanding, the type of value expected. It's just about clean code, performance and code understanding.

const [variable, setVariable] = useState('');
const [variable, setVariable] = useState([]);
const [variable, setVariable] = useState({});

# How to add information to the variable!
> setVariable([...variable, X])
useState set function, have to define an entire new value for the variable, so we need to use spread operator "...variable," which means that is copying the last value, adding the new value after the ",".
