# Like counter (using State)
```js
    // 1. The state
    const [likeCount, setLikeCount] = useState(0);

    // 2. The handling function
    function handleLikeComment(){
        setLikeCount(likeCount + 1);
    }

    // 3. The activation of the function
    <button onClick={handleLikeComment}>
        <HandsClapping size={24}/> Applause <span>{likeCount}</span>
    </button>
```



## Arrow Functions (Anonyous Function, but its imperative concept)
A function that its not created (will be only used few times, or in unique times.)
```js
    <button onClick={() => setApplauseCount(applauseCount + 1)}>
    </button>
```
In this case above, the way to use Declarative/Imperative is questionable.
As you can see, the setLikeCount is already very clear and transparent to understand what is happening. So maybe in this case, we don't need a declarative function. In addition to that, that's not even another component of the interface that is using the applause concept at the moment (But probably will since we have to be able to applause posts)

> Declarative vs Imperative 
### Declarative
```js
    <button onClick={handleApplauseCount}>
    </button>
```

### Imperative
```js
    <button onClick={() => setApplauseCount(applauseCount + 1)}>
        Applause
    </button>
```
