# Closures on React

## A set of an state only will be substituted with the new stance of the state, after the function has been finalized.
The result of the following console.log with the likes value, will be: 1
```js
    const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0)

    function addLike(){
        setLikes(likes + 1); // 1. Create a new instance of "likes" with + 1, that will be substituted at the end of the whole function
        setLikes(likes + 1); // 2. This is not (1 + 1), because 'likes' is still 0, before end of the whole function. This is still (1 + 1)
        setLikes(likes + 1); // 3. This is not (2 + 1), because 'likes' is still 0, before end of the whole function. This is still (1 + 1)
    }
    
    console.log(likes) // Finally the result will be: 0 + 1 = 1
```


## Alternative to handle states inside a function:


### Declarative:
```js
    function addLike(){
        let newLikesCount = likes + 1;
        setLikes(newLikesCount + 1);
    }
```

### React - Arrow Function using Prototype Property of useState.
```js
    function addLike(){
        setLikes((stateX) => {return state + 1}); // (anyNameForThis) => Will be the most recent value of the state being set. Because it will be updated at the !end of this arrow function!.
        setLikes((stateX) => {return state + 1});
        setLikes((stateX) => {return state + 1});
    }
```

> This will add 3 to the initial state.
