# Key in React

## Why unique
3 times when a component is re-rendered in React.
1. When the state changes;
2. When property changes;
3. When a parent component re-renders;


With a key, React can identify what has to be reendered, and what has not. Getting better performance and not having risk to accidentally change the renders (positions of list and contents)
1, 2, 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

## Why can't I use array index?
```js
const posts = [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]
// 1, 2, 5, 4, 3
```
