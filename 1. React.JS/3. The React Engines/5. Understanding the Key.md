# Key in React

## Why unique
3 times when a component is re-rendered in React.
1. When the state changes;
2. When property changes;
3. When a parent component re-renders;


## With a key, React can identify what has to be reendered, and what has not. Getting better performance and not having risk to accidentally change the renders (positions of list and contents)
POSITION = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
ID= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

If one of them changes we got misunderstood data, and we lost the performance we could have. Because React will have to render all it again noticing that keys are different.

## Why can't I use array index?
```js
const posts = [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]
// 1, 2, 5, 4, 3
```
