# Properties in components

Everytime we create a new instance of a component,

We can give properties to the components, naming them on the creation (TypeScript require a Interface to check the data of the component)

On the component file, we receive the following properties on a variable that we can declare as the way we want, but normally called as "props"

> export default Component(props) { }

After this we can use the data received through the properties defined on the call of the component, for example:

<Component propertyA="This is a text" propertyB=2 propertyC="Other type of data" />


And in the Component file:
 
>export default Component(props) { 
>   return (
>       <> 
>           <h1>The A is: {props.propertyA}</h1> 
>           <p>The number is: {props.propertyB}</p> 
>           <p>{props.propertyC}</p> 
>       </h1> 
>   )
>   }

So this way we can replicate with different data on properties:

<Component name="Muri" />
<Component name="Gui" />
<Component name="Etc." />
