# We can also send parent FUNCTIONS from compoments to child components.

The same way we can send properties, we can send a function as a prop.

> Example
Post.jsx (Has the Array of comments) 
-> So the delete function have to be here, where is the access to the State of comments.

Comment.jsx (Has a button of delete)
-> So the intention to delete the comment starts from here.


## 1. POST

1. Have to be the 'function deleteComment' with the parameter of the defined identifier on the .map =>
> Example: .map(comment => ...) The identifier is 'comment'
So this way we get the data to work for handle (delete in this case)

2. When we render the child component, we send a property that will execute the function
> <Comment onClickDeleteComment={deleteComment} />

# COMMENT

1. Have also to be a native function from content, handleDeleteComment (for example).
> Will execute the function received from the props
props.onClickDeleteComment(props.content) // Because in the state of Comment, they are an array of strings

2. The function will be executed, when we put a onClick={handleDeleteComment} on the delete button.

1. On delete button, have to exist a onClick={handleDeleteComment}
