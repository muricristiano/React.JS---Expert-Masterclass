> We can destructurate this props into objects, and mainly, set default values to them

export function Avatar(props) {

}


> Explanation and example of how:

const user = { name: John }

const { name } = user; // THIS IS HOW.

> So in the component function we can declare this way:

export function Avatar({ hasBorder, src }) {

}


> Setting default values would be like this:

export function Avatar( {hasBorder = false, src }) {
}

> So if we receive the prop as true, we change it. If we don't receive, it's false by default.
