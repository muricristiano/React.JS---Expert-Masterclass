# focus re-styling globally
:focus {
    outline: transparent;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--color-one);
}


# Nice strategy to hide a button and only show when the form is focused:

> BUTTON inside the FOOTER (the only element): This is assuring that the max-height is set to 0 properly when invisble;

.commentForm footer {
    visibility: hidden;
    max-height: 0;
}

.commentForm:focus-within footer {
    visibility: visible;
    max-height: none;
}


# .commentForm:focus-within footer 
> This means that when any element inside commentForm is focused, the 'footer' will have different attributes (In the last example, we turn the button(footer) visibility into 'visible' when the textarea is focused)
