# React Router (The most famous library for routes in React)
Library to handle routes/pages

# We are going to use the React Router 'DOM' (The package for WEB)
> npm i react-router-dom

1. create the directory for the pages:
> /src/pages
Inside we create the pages (Will be 2, only Home and History on this project. But you got the concept)

2. create a component for the React Router handling on the root folder:
Router.tss, the mechanics from the library imported are this way:
```ts
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

import { Home } from './pages/Home'
import { History } from './pages/History'

export function Router() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/history" element={<History />} />
    </Routes>
  )
}
```


3. > on App.tsx
We have to import the { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom' and envolve the <Router/> so the tag <BrowserRouter> can handle it. and Router, handles routes.

App.tsx
```ts
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
export function App() {
    <BrowserRouter>
        <Router />
    </BrowserRouter>
}
```
